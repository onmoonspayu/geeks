            <h4 class="hdd_head">1. Subscription Terms</h4>
            <p class="para_graph">
                The Service is offered on a subscription basis for a one-time fee (Subscription). We do not charge automatically or renew subscriptions without your consent. Once the subscription period ends, we will contact you to offer a renewal. It is entirely your choice whether to continue with the subscription or not.
            </p>
            <p class="para_graph">All applicable prices are clearly stated on the payment page. Please review the payment details carefully before completing your purchase. The full subscription fee is charged as a single transaction at the time of purchase.</p>

            <h4 class="hdd_head">2. Pricing and Payment</h4>
            <p class="para_graph">
                All applicable prices are clearly displayed on the payment page at the time of purchase. Please review all pricing information carefully before proceeding.
            </p>
            <p class="para_graph">
                The full subscription fee is charged in a single transaction at the time of purchase using the payment method you provide. We do not split the charge or apply automatic recurring payments.
            </p>
            <p class="para_graph">
                Payment processing is handled securely via our authorized third-party payment provider. Depending on your bank or card issuer, additional fees such as currency conversion or transaction charges may apply.
            </p>
            
            <h4 class="hdd_head">3. Trial Offers</h4>
            <p class="para_graph">We may occasionally offer a paid trial for a nominal fee. At the end of the trial period, your access will expire unless you choose to purchase a full subscription. You will not be charged automatically after the trial ends unless you actively opt into a subscription.</p>
            <p class="para_graph">Discounted or promotional subscriptions may also be offered. These do not auto-renew and will require manual renewal at the standard rate once the discount period ends.

</p>
            
            <h4 class="hdd_head">4. Cancellation Policy</h4>
            <p class="para_graph">Since we do not use auto-renewal, there is no need to cancel ongoing charges. Your access to the service will simply expire at the end of your subscription period unless you choose to renew.</p>
            <p class="para_graph">If you wish to discontinue your use before your subscription ends, your account will remain active through the end of your paid period.</p>
            <p class="para_graph">You can contact us for any subscription-related queries through the following methods:</p>
            <p class="para_graph"><strong>* Live chat support</strong></p>

            <h4 class="hdd_head">5. Refund Policy</h4>
            <p class="para_graph">
                You may request a refund within 30 days of your initial registration. If eligible, we will issue a full or partial refund of the subscription fee, including any applicable setup or joining fees.
