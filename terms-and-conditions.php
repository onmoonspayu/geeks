                    <p class="para_graph">
                        Appliancia is an informational and educational platform that provides an opportunity for users seeking advice or assistance (the “Customers”) to ask questions on the Website and receive answers from users with specific knowledge and
                        skills (the “Experts”). The Customers and the Experts are collectively referred to as the “Users”. Appliancia exists solely to facilitates communication between the Experts and Customers. Appliancia does not provide or sell
                        information or education that is within any Expert's area of expertise. Appliancia is not involved in the communication between the Customers and the Experts, does not refer the Customers to or endorse or recommend particular Experts
                        and does not generate any kind of the Content (as defined in Section 1.3.) for the Users. EMERGENCY QUESTIONS AND CRISIS SITUATIONS (particularly regarding medical or mental health issues) should not be directed to the Website and
                        should, instead be directed immediately by telephone or in-person to qualified professionals (e.g., in the U.S., call 911). The Website is not the appropriate venue to deal with such situations. Please note that some of the
                        communications you receive on the Website, such as basic questions asked before you sign up, greetings, opening lines may be provided by the automatic bot rather than Experts. The substantive responses are never provided by the
                        automatic bot.

                        1.2. The Experts
                    </h4>
                    <p class="para_graph">
                        The Experts are not employees or agents of Appliancia but are independent service providers using the Website to promote their knowledge to the Customers and, as such, together with the Customers, are the Users of the Website. The
                        term “Expert” is used by Appliancia and on the Website solely to describe the Users who answer questions on the Website, and does not to guarantee any particular level of qualification, education or expertise of these Experts.

                        Appliancia does not verify and does not warrant or guarantee the Expert's purported identity. Some Experts on the Website may get the status of a “verified Expert” visible to all Users. If a Expert is verified, it means that we have
                        verified at least one credential relevant to the category in which that Expert is answering questions. Such credentials may include relevant education, training, professional experience or other relevant expertise, or background.

                    <p class="para_graph">

                        guarantee the truthfulness or accuracy of the credentials of Experts and information provided by Experts. You acknowledge that Appliancia will not be liable for any loss or damages caused by your reliance on any information or

                        The Experts determine which questions to answer and which response to provide on their own. The Expert may provide basic advice or other information, including recommendations on how a certain problem may be fixed or otherwise
                        addressed. No technical or physical repairs are delivered via the Website and the Expert will not perform any such repairs.

                    <h4 class="hdd_sub_head">12.1. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement
                        <p class="para_graph"> This Arbitration Agreement governs any dispute between you and Appliancia (and each of our respective agents, corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns) including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and Appliancia, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement; and claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms. However, (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify within the scope of your jurisdiction; and (2) you or Appliancia may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the effective date of these Terms or any prior version of these Terms.
                            The relevant arbitrator shall have sole authority to determine applicability of the Arbitration Agreement in each particular case. In the event that a dispute involves both issues that are subject to arbitration and issues that are not subject to arbitration, the parties unequivocally agree that any legal proceeding regarding the issues not subject to arbitration shall be stayed pending resolution of the issues subject to arbitration.</p>

                        <h4 class="hdd_sub_head">12.2. Initial Dispute Resolution</h4>
                        <p class="para_graph"> Most disputes can be resolved without resort to arbitration. If you have any dispute with Appliancia, you agree that before taking any formal action, you will contact us at support@appliancia.com, and provide a brief, written description of the dispute and your contact information. The parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with Appliancia, and good faith negotiations will be a condition to either party initiating an arbitration.</p>

                        <h4 class="hdd_sub_head"> 12.3. Binding Arbitration</h4>
                        <p class="para_graph"> If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of sixty (60) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including the Terms formation, performance, and breach), the parties' relationship with each other, and/or your use of the Website will be finally settled by binding arbitration before one arbitrator administered by:</p>
                        <p class="para_graph"> (1) the London Court of International Arbitration (“LCIA”) if you are not a U.S. resident. Disputes are subject to the most current version of the LCIA Arbitration Rules when the notice of arbitration is submitted. Information about the LCIA's rules can be found at https://www.lcia.org/Dispute_Resolution_Services/LCIA_Arbitration.aspx; or</p>
                        <p class="para_graph"> (2) JAMS if you are a U.S. resident. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys' fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS's most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other claims shall be subject to JAMS's most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMS's rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.</p>
                        <p class="para_graph"> In each case the relevant arbitration rules will apply as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. In the event of a conflict between the applicable arbitration rules and these Terms, these Terms shall govern unless otherwise agreed by the parties and the relevant arbitrator.</p>
                        <p class="para_graph"> If the relevant administrator of arbitration is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.</p>

                        <h4 class="hdd_sub_head">12.4. Arbitration Proceedings</h4>
                        <p class="para_graph"> Initiating Arbitration. To start an arbitration, you must follow instructions available at:</p>
                        <p class="para_graph"> (1) https://www.lcia.org/adr-services/lcia-notes-for-parties.aspx#5.%20COMMENCING%20AN%20LCIA%20ARBITRATION for LCIA; or</p>

                        <p class="para_graph"> Arbitration Fees. If you are a consumer and you initiate arbitration, the only fee required to be paid is $250 and the other part of the filing fee (if any) will be borne by us. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration initiated by you to be non-frivolous and/or not in bad faith, all other arbitration costs will be borne by Appliancia. If Appliancia initiates arbitration against you and you are a consumer, Appliancia will pay for all costs associated with the arbitration. The parties are responsible for paying their own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.</p>
                        <p class="para_graph"> Should either party bring a dispute involving issues subject to arbitration in a forum other than arbitration, the court or the arbitrator shall have the authority to award reasonable costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by the other party in successfully staying or dismissing, in whole or in part, such other proceeding or in otherwise enforcing compliance with this Arbitration Agreement.</p>

                        <p class="para_graph"> Arbitrator Selection. The arbitrator must be neutral, and you will have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the process of choosing the arbitrator.
                            Arbitration Hearings. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference (based on written and/or electronic filing of documents), rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances, provided that if you are a consumer, you have a right to an in-person hearing in your hometown area. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the administrator of arbitration or by the arbitrator.</p>

                        <p class="para_graph"> Consumer Remedies. If you are a consumer, remedies that would otherwise be available to you under applicable laws will remain available under this Arbitration Agreement, unless you retain the right to pursue such remedies in court as per this Agreement.</p>
                        <p class="para_graph"> Discovery of Non-privileged Information. As part of the arbitration, both you and we will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the claim.</p>
                        <p class="para_graph"> Upon either party's request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted filing of confidential information must be done under seal.</p>
                        <p class="para_graph"> Communications with the Arbitrator. Whenever communicating with the arbitrator, the parties must include each other – for example, by including the other party on a telephone conference call and copying the other party on any written submissions, such as letters or emails. To the extent practicable, conferences with the arbitrator will take place by telephone conference call or email. Ex parte communications are not permitted with any arbitrator.</p>
                        <p class="para_graph"> Choice of Law. The arbitrator shall apply:</p>
                        <p class="para_graph"> 1) if you are not a U.S. resident, the laws of England and Wales (also known as English Law), without regard to English Law's conflict of laws rules; or</p>
                        <p class="para_graph"> 2) if you are a U.S. resident, Delaware law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law.</p>
                        <p class="para_graph"> Arbitrator's Award. An arbitrator's award will consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim. The award will also provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</p>
                        <p class="para_graph"> The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the parties. Judgment on the arbitrator's award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

                        <h4 class="hdd_sub_head"> 12.5. Class Action Waiver and Jury Trial Waiver</h4>
                        <p class="para_graph"> THE ARBITRATOR HAS NO AUTHORITY TO AWARD PUNITIVE DAMAGES. NEITHER YOU NOR Appliancia AGREES TO ANY ARBITRATION ON A CLASS BASIS, AND THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO PROCEED ON SUCH A BASIS. A PARTY MAY ASSERT A CLAIM OR COUNTERCLAIM ONLY IN THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF CLASS PROCEEDING. UNDER THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT COMBINE OR CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PARTIES CLAIMS WITHOUT THE WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL AFFECTED PARTIES TO AN ARBITRATION PROCEEDING.</p>
                        <p class="para_graph"> BY AGREEING TO THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES AS SET FORTH HEREIN, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND LIMITING YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHTS TO OTHER AVAILABLE RESOLUTION PROCESSES, SUCH AS A COURT ACTION.</p>

                        <h4 class="hdd_sub_head">12.6. Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims</h4>
                        <p class="para_graph"> Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in court with jurisdiction or in other relevant state authority to protect its intellectual property rights. Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.</p>

                        <h4 class="hdd_sub_head">12.7. 30-Day Right to Opt Out</h4>
                        <p class="para_graph"> You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending electronic notice of your decision to opt out to support@appliancia.com with the subject line, “ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT.” The notice must be sent within 30 days of (a) the effective date of these Terms; or (b) your first date that you used the Website that contained any versions of the Terms that substantially included this version of the Arbitration Agreement (including class action waiver), whichever is later. Otherwise, you will be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, Appliancia also will not be bound by it.
                            In order to be effective, the opt out notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with Section 16.1 “Governing Law and Venue.”</p>

                        <h4 class="hdd_sub_head">12.8. Severability of Arbitration Agreement</h4>
                        <p class="para_graph"> If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement or the parties' ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in court in accordance with Section 16.1 “Governing Law and Venue,” and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Arbitration Agreement is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable.</p>

                        <h4 class="hdd_head">12.9. Survival</h4>
